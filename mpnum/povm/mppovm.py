r'''Matrix-product representation of POVMs

This module provides the following classes:

* :class:`MPPovm`: A matrix product representation of a multi-site
  POVM.

  For example, for a linear chain of `n` qubits this class can
  represent the POVM of the observable `XX...X` with :math:`2^n`
  elements efficiently. It is also possible to sample from the
  probability distribution of this POVM efficiently.

* :class:`MPPovmList`: A list of MP-POVMs.

  This class can be used e.g. to obtain estimated expectation values
  of the local observable `XX1...1` on two qubits from from samples
  for the global observables `XX...X` and `XXY...Y` (cf. below on
  :ref:`mppovm-lfun-overview`).

* The methods :func:`MPPovm.embed`,
  :func:`MPPovm.block`/:func:`MPPovmList.block`,
  :func:`MPPovm.repeat`/:func:`MPPovmList.repeat` as well as
  :func:`pauli_mpp` and :func:`pauli_mpps` allow for convenient
  construction of MP-POVMs and MP-POVM lists.

Linear combinations of functions of POVM outcomes
=====

In order to perform the just mentioned estimation of probabilities of
one POVM from samples of another POVM with possibly larger support, we
provide a function which can estimate linear functions of functions of
POVM outcomes: Let :math:`M` a finite index set with real elements
:math:`y \in M \subset \mathbb R` such that :math:`\hat y` are the
positive semidefinite POVM elements which sum to the identity,
:math:`\sum_{y \in M} \hat y = 1`. Given a state :math:`\rho`, the
probability mass function (PMF) of the probability distribution given
by the POVM and the state can be expressed as :math:`p_y =
\operatorname{tr}(\rho \hat y)`, :math:`y \in M` or as :math:`p(x) =
\sum_{y \in M} \delta(x - y) p_y`. Let further :math:`D = (x_1,
\ldots, x_m)`, :math:`x_k \in M` a set of samples from :math:`p(x)`
and let :math:`f \colon M \to \mathbb R` an arbitrary function of the
POVM outcomes. The true value :math:`\langle f \rangle_p = \int f(y)
p(y) \mathrm d y` can then be estimated using the sample average
:math:`\langle f \rangle_D = \frac1m \sum_{k=1}^m f(x_k) p_{x_k}`. In
the same way, a linear combination :math:`f = \sum c_i f_i` of
functions :math:`f_i \colon M \to \mathbb R` of POVM outcomes can be
estimated by :math:`\langle f \rangle_D = \sum_i c_i \langle f_i
\rangle_D`. Such a linear combination of functions of POVM outcomes
can be estimated using :func:`MPPovm.est_lfun()`. More technically,
the relation :math:`\langle \langle f \rangle_D \rangle_{p_m} =
\langle f \rangle_p` shows that :math:`\langle f \rangle_D` is an
unbiased estimator for the true expectation value :math:`\langle f
\rangle_p`; the probability distribution of the dataset :math:`D` is
given by the sampling distribution :math:`p_m(D) = p(x_1) \ldots
p(x_m)`.

Estimates of the POVM probabilities :math:`p_y` can also be expressed
as functions of this kind: Consider the function

.. math::

   \theta_y(x) =
   \begin{cases}
     1, & x = y, \\
     0, & \text{otherwise.}
   \end{cases}

The true value of this function under :math:`p(x)` is :math:`\langle
\theta_y \rangle_p = p_y` and the sample average :math:`\langle
\theta_y \rangle_D` provides an estimator for :math:`p_y`. In order to
estimate probabilities of one POVM from samples for another POVM, such
a function can be used: E.g. to estimate the probability of the
:math:`(+1, +1)` outcome of the POVM `XX1...1`, we can define a
function which is equal to 1 if the outcome of the POVM `XX...X` on
the first two sites is equal to :math:`(+1, +1)` and zero
otherwise. The sample average of this function over samples for the
latter POVM `XX...X` will estimate the desired probability. This
approach is implemented in :func:`MPPovm.est_pmf_from()`. If samples
from more than one POVM are available for estimating a given
probability, a weighted average of estimators can be used as
implemented in :func:`MPPovm.est_pmf_from_mpps()`; the list of
MP-POVMs for which samples are available is passed as an
:class:`MPPovmList` instance. Finally, the function
:func:`MPPovmList.est_lfun_from` allows estimation of a linear
combination of probabilities from different POVMs using samples of a
second list of MP-POVMs. This function also estimates the variance of
the estimate. In order to perform the two estimation procedures, for
each probability, we construct an estimator from a weighted average of
functions of outcomes of different POVMs, as has been explained
above. For more simple settings, :func:`MPPovmList.est_lfun` is also
available.

True values of the functions just mentioned can be obtained from
:func:`MPPovm.lfun`, :func:`MPPovmList.lfun` and
:func:`MPPovmList.lfun_from`. All functions return both the true
expectation value and the variance of the expectation value.

The variance of the (true) expectation value :math:`\langle f
\rangle_p` of a function :math:`f\colon M \to \mathbb R` is given by
:math:`\operatorname{var}_p(f) = \operatorname{cov}_p(f, f)` with
:math:`\operatorname{cov}_p(f, g) = \langle fg \rangle_p - \langle f
\rangle_p \langle g \rangle_p`. The variance of the estimate
:math:`\langle f \rangle_D` is given by
:math:`\operatorname{var}_{p_m}(\langle f \rangle_D) = \frac1m
\operatorname{var}_p(f)` where :math:`p_m(D)` is the sampling
distribution from above. An unbiased estimator for the covariance
:math:`\operatorname{cov}_p(f, g)` is given by :math:`\frac{m}{m-1}
\operatorname{cov}_D(f, g)` where the sample covariance
:math:`\operatorname{cov}_D(f, g)` is defined in terms of sample
averages in the usual way, :math:`\operatorname{cov}_D(f, g) = \langle
fg \rangle_D - \langle f \rangle_D \langle g \rangle_D`. This
estimator is used by :func:`MPPovm.est_lfun`.

.. todo::

   Explain the details of the variance estimation, in particular the
   difference between the variances returned from
   :func:`MPPovmList.lfun` and :func:`MPPovmList.lfun_from`. Check the
   mean square error.

   Add a good references explaining all facts mentioned above and for
   further reading.

   Document the runtime and memory cost of the functions.

    """MPArray representation of multipartite POVM

    There are two different ways to write down a POVM in matrix product form

    1) As a list of matrix product operators, where each entry corresponds to
        a single POVM element

    2) As a matrix proudct array with 3 physical legs:

                [POVM index, column index, row index]

       that is, the first physical leg of the MPArray corresponds to
       the index of the POVM element. This representation is
       especially helpful for computing expectation values with
       MPSs/MPDOs.

    Here, we choose the second.

    .. todo:: This class should provide a function which returns
        expectation values as full array. (Even though computing
        expectation values using the POVM struture brings advantages,
        we usually need the result as full array.) This function
        should also replace small negative probabilities by zero and
        normalize the sum of all probabilities to unity (if the
        deviation is non-zero but small). The same checks should also
        be implemented in localpovm.POVM.

    .. todo:: Right now we use this class for multi-site POVMs with
        elements obtained from every possible combination of the
        elements of single-site POVMs: The POVM index is split across
        all sites. Explore whether and how this concept can also be
        useful in other cases.
